# MiSu_Website

A remote repository for: 'Live Brief: MiSu' - a client website as part of an accredited education programme.

Iâ€™m learning the basics of Git, Github and Dreamweaver. This repo is for an experimental prototype, for the live brief module on the MA in Creative App Development at Falmouth University.
